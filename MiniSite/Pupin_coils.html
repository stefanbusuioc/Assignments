        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called <b><q>Pupin coils</q></b>, followed closely 
        on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which 
        predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when 
        the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him 
        wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had 
        their own development in hand led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ashley_Campbell" target="_blank">George Campbell</a> and had up to this point been challenging 
        Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention 
        which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance 
        telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
